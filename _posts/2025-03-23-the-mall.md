Both kids hung at the mall at some point today... a bit out of the ordinary typical weekend routines I guess.

Did get to try this Mexican joint and sat outside to enjoy the nice weather though.

Have not seen this forever and a day. Shoutout to Flores for bringing this back as the "thanks for coming" send-off.
