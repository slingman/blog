Today there was a couple of bad news, but it was a rather eventful day overall.  I have no pictures to support any of these, as you know... pic taking wasn't exactly the first thing to come to mind... 

First Raiden and I got our haircuts, that went rather smoothly without a glitch.

There is a backup from the washer's outgoing hose last night, but I was lucky enough to get an appointment today and have them fix it today, even though they showed up 2 hours later than they were supposed to.

And its just coming down REAL hard with the rain here.. So we decided to go have shabu shabu for dinner.  I was able to stop by the Japanese supermarket after the washer got looked at by the plumber.

And then we found out that 2 of the inlaws tested positive for Covid, and it looks like tiff and I have not been feeling very well all day as is... sore throat city with both of us.

We are supposed to be getting ready to go to Palm Desert tomorrow, not sure that is still happening, as it is now snowing along with icy road conditions on I-5 on the Grapevine. ALso we are sick.

This sucks.
