Dinner.

Tri-tip from Trader Joe's.  Leave out at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.

Put in a pre-heated oven at 250F.

Check for internal temperature after the meat has been in oven for an hour. 160F will give you a medium done meat.

I took the meat out of the oven and let it sit there for about 10 minutes which then brought the meat's internal temperature up to about 165. And then I put the meat on the grill for about 3 minutes on each side and then removed it from the grill and let sit for about 20 minutes covered with alumimum foil before I cut it up and served.

Slow roast and cooking is the way to go if you got the time!
