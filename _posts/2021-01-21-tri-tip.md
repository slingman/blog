Dinner.

Tri-tip from Trader Joe's.  Leave out at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.

Put in a pre-heated oven at 250F.

Check for internal temperature after the meat has been in oven for an hour. 165F will give you a medium done meat.

I put the meat on the gril for about 3 minutes on each side and let sit for about 20 minutes before cutting into it.
