There's a pretty interesting story behind this pair.

This way back when where I had a friend that I met on Niketalk to make these customs.  These are just some regular ole white flyknit trainers that I had custom painted to make look like a pair of HTM flyknit trainers.

I have lost touch with this friend, he's from Australia, I have not heard from him ever since he decided to quit all social media.
