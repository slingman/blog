Well that's a wrap folks, Project 365 2021 is now complete. I really didn't think I could do this, as I failed 3 months in miserably in 2013. I supposed the advancement in the phone camera's technology have made this way easier to do.

Everyone is doing some sorta look back... I guess I don't need to as you can just scroll back... :P Its even pretty astonishing to see myself with what happened in 2021... But needless to say it was filled with ups, downs, happiness, stress, and anxiety like many for sure.

Let's take a look at today in pics, shall we?

Now that the pics for my last post of the year/project is done, I truely hope 2022 will be a better one filled with more happiness and less anxiety. At this very moment at least, however, its not great as I am ringing in the New Year with the assumption that I am Covid+. 

But just remember, kids, just like everything else in life, count your blessings, it can ALWAYS be worst.

See y'all next year, signing off for now.
