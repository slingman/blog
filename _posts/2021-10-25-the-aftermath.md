Not to be dramatic, but we didn't get our power back till like 8:30 am this morning.  The power went out at around 1:30 pm yesterday.

Shits were not working.  Had to pump heater at the beta's tank, as its been cold all night.

Got to finish the laundry that was in the dryer and reset everything back to normal.  This rain was much welcomed though, boy did we need it.
