Turns out there was water pipe burst in one of the buildings in the complex, and our building's pipes are connected to that buildings... so water had to be turned off. :'( So we ended up at Tiff's old job to shower.

The water came back around 4:00pm so that was nice. Kids got to shower after korean bbq... would've been bad if they had to sleep through that korean bbq funk. :P
