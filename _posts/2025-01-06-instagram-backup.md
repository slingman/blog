I have been trying to back up my Instagram photos to Google Photos to sync up to Flickr as double backup, that apparently hasn't been working that well.

But I finally got it to work somewhat by manually downloading the back up to Google Photos and downloading the said backup and uploading it manually to Flickr, seems like a lot of work but I think its worth my time so that I can show them off on this blog.

As such...
