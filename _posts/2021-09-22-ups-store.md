Last year, during the height of the pandemic, the only outdoor activity that the kids got was really me making them walk to the UPS store with me as I drop off different sales of sneakers and what not.

This year, that all changed, thanks to Pokemon I guess. Granted, Raiden is hotspotting off of my phone with his non-sim-card-enabled phone. He requests to go out for walks now even on the weekends.  Crazy how things change with the dude.
