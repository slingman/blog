Dreading the Monday after this long two week break. It was a good rest, looking back though.

The highlight of today was really just my daughter decided to make her own milk tea. 

Its somewhat of a recipe that requires patience, she had decided to do a cold brew over night with some loose leaf tea - ***Jasmine Pearl Downey from Peet's***.  She had seem me making this before.  Since then she had figured out the right amount of milk to add to the tea along with the right amount of sugar.
