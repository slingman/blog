Our favorite bakery from LA - <a href="https://www.dukebakery.sg/" target="new">Duke Bakery</a> - and go figure, they came from Singapore. We always bring a bunch back and freeze them, and heat them when we ready to eat it.  This particular one, I thought it was matcha red bean, but it was just matcha - super delicious.
