Spent most of the day today resting.  The kids are bummed that we are not going on our trip. :'( I feel bad.

Decided that it was probably at good idea to get tested for Covid, so the entire family drove to a nearby testing site, seemed to have been an impossible task to get a covid testing sorted at the moment, but we were able to get to this...
