The name of the game today is tools. 

I think the microwave's fuse is blown, so I went to Home Depot last night to purchase a microwave fuse. This was after I watched a Youtube video of course.

I have to unlatch the microwave's panel in order to get to the fuse that is blown, but the screwdrivers I have at home are real pieces of shit.  So I borrowed some from a friend nearby.  That still don't work. Urggggh.  Will try to get a new tool tomorrow I guess.
