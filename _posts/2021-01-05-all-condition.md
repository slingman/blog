The pictures for today seem to align with some of the different phases of my life so far...

### Barley tea
There is technically no barley in this tea I believe, it's just really "hints" of barley in black tea as the Chinese name suggests.  I drank this quite often growing up in Taiwan, probably chubs becuase of that!

### Nike's
Both of these wildwoods here are older than my kids, the original wildwood is from 2003, the lunarwoods are from 2010.  They have both also been and traveled to more places than my kids... :-)

### Grilling
Here we have a picture that represents something I just recently acquired.  One of the favorite things that the kids love is grilled Korean short ribs, as a result, we eat that often as one of our dinner, but with the shortened days in the winter months, I find myself using the flashlight from my phone to grill.  So this light situation needs to be improved, hence this portable, battery powered LED light that can be attached practically anywhere comes in quite handy...

So... You see? Somewhat representative of my life so far... :P
