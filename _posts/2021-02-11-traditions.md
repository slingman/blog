Its another day, or is it?  This year, the Lunar New Year falls on February 12th, so that means today is Lunar New Year's eve.  This means its dinner at the inlaws as that is the closest family we have out here.

Not as big of a feast as previous years and such because of the covid circumstances obviously.
