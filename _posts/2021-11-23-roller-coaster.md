Today was... 

First, went to get my boster shot, taught some lady to windmill after she gets her shot.

Then I got the news that my dad got a stroke and has now become unconcscious after hitting the floor in the bathroom. :'(

Eric, Cindy, and I now have made a joint decision to not operate and see if he himself can make a comeback.

All these while I try to sort out a way to fly back to Singapore.
