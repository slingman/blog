Bestbuy, Home Depot, GE, and almost every other big box stores sells the appliances at a lower price, but charges an arm and a leg to install the said appliance, in addition to that, they charge you for haul away of the said appliance. So... I went with Costco instead, delivery and installation included, still a $100 bucks less than the prices I saw at the others.
